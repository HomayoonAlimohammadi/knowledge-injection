# Fine-Grained Domain Adaptation for Large Language Models Using Knowledge Injection

## Quick Brief:
This is an end-to-end implementation (in Python) of a proof-of-concept for fine-grained domain adaptation of a large language model with an example of knowledge injection. We will:

- Load a base pretrained model (e.g., GPT-2) from Hugging Face.
- Use a toy domain-specific dataset (small mocked examples) for demonstration.
- Incorporate a small knowledge dictionary to inject domain-specific terms/definitions directly into the input.
- Fine-tune the model using Hugging Face’s Trainer on a text classification task.
- Evaluate and provide ways to measure domain adaptation improvements.
- **Note**: This is a demonstrative prototype. For a real-world application, replace the toy dataset with a larger, curated domain corpus. Also, adapt or extend the knowledge-injection logic to suit your domain’s complexity.

## Objective: 
Adapt a pre-trained large language model (e.g., GPT-2, BERT, or any Transformer-based model) to a specific specialized domain (e.g., clinical medicine, quantum physics).

## Innovation: 
Incorporate external domain knowledge into the model by injecting relevant terminologies or short definitions as additional context during training.

## Key Techniques:
- Utilize Hugging Face Transformers to load a base model.
- Use a domain-specific corpus to further pre-train or fine-tune the model.
- Implement a knowledge-injection mechanism that augments or re-ranks tokens based on domain vocabularies or concept definitions.
- Evaluate improvements on specialized tasks like domain-specific text classification or masked language modeling accuracy.

## Outcome: 
Demonstrates advanced domain adaptation, bridging general-purpose LLM capabilities with specialized domain knowledge.

## Installation:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
```

## Explanation of the Key Steps:
1. **Mock Dataset**: We create a small dataset containing medical-like sentences (label=1) and unrelated general sentences (label=0).
2. **Knowledge Dictionary**: Contains a few key medical terms (myocardial infarction, ECG, dyspnea, etc.) and short definitions.
3. **Knowledge Injection**: A function inject_knowledge(...) that appends domain definitions whenever it encounters a known keyword in the text. We insert them using a delimiter "[KNOWLEDGE]" so the model receives direct domain context.
4. **Tokenizer & Preprocessing**: We apply GPT-2’s tokenizer with max_length=64 to keep the example small. We set the pad_token to eos_token for GPT-2.
5. **Model**: We load GPT2ForSequenceClassification with num_labels=2 for a simple binary classification.
6. **Trainer**: We use Hugging Face’s Trainer API with a small learning rate and a few epochs (num_train_epochs=3).
7. **Evaluation**: We measure accuracy using a built-in Hugging Face metric.
8. **Inference**: Shows how to apply knowledge injection at inference time and get predictions from the fine-tuned model.

## Possible Extensions:
- **Larger Domain Corpus**: Integrate a substantial domain corpus (e.g., a collection of medical articles) for more realistic adaptation.
- **Refined Knowledge Integration**: Instead of simple text concatenation, consider more sophisticated approaches like gating networks or attention-based injection of external knowledge.
- **Advanced Evaluation**: Go beyond classification—evaluate perplexity for domain-specific language modeling, or measure F1 scores for domain-specific tasks (e.g., NER).
- **Use A More Recent Foundation Model**: Instead of GPT-2, one could use GPT-Neo, GPT-J, LLaMA, or another modern large-scale model (depending on hardware resources).
